# move_construct_assignment


/**
 * @class MoveArrayList
 * @brief A class that extends ArrayList to add move semantics.
 * 
 * The MoveArrayList class inherits from ArrayList and adds move constructor
 * and move assignment operator functionality. This allows MoveArrayList to 
 * efficiently transfer resources from one instance to another without 
 * performing deep copies, which can enhance performance when dealing with 
 * temporary objects or in situations where copying is not necessary.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Inherits constructors and methods from ArrayList.
 * - Implements move constructor to transfer ownership of resources.
 * - Implements move assignment operator to handle resource transfer.
 * - Utilizes the existing copy constructor and copy assignment operator 
 *   from ArrayList for copying behavior.
